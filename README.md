1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: The model gathers and processes extensive data on past and current property listings in the Boston area. This data includes information on the size of the property, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, proximity to amenities, historical sales data, and more.

2. Feature Engineering: The model identifies and extracts relevant features from the dataset, such as square footage, lot size, crime rates, school quality, and transportation access. These features are crucial in understanding the factors that influence property prices.

3. Machine Learning Algorithms: The heart of the model consists of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks. These algorithms analyze the relationships between the selected features and property prices to make predictions.

4. Training and Validation: The model is trained on a large dataset of historical property prices and continuously refined to improve its accuracy. Validation techniques are employed to ensure the model's performance on new, unseen data.

5. Predictive Analytics: Once trained, the model can take input parameters related to a specific property and its location. It then generates an estimated selling price for that property based on its understanding of past market trends and current conditions.

6. Visualization: Users can visualize the model's predictions through graphs, charts, or interactive maps, allowing for a better understanding of how different factors impact property prices.

7. Error Analysis: The model provides insights into the degree of confidence in its predictions and identifies influential factors that may affect the accuracy of the estimates.
